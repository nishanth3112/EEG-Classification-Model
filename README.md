# EEG-Classification-Model
This project utilizes two comprehensive EEG datasets to train, validate, and test the deep learning models for epileptic seizure detection.

## Datasets
### 1. CHB-MIT EEG Database
Description: A curated collection of EEG recordings developed by the Childrenâ€™s Hospital Boston and MIT.
Focus: 
Contains recordings from pediatric patients.
Includes both seizure and non-seizure events.
Applications: Ideal for studying epilepsy and developing machine learning models to differentiate between normal and epileptic brain activities.
Key Features:
High-quality EEG recordings.
Diverse data with a mix of seizure types and non-seizure events.
Pediatric-focused dataset.

### 2. Bonn EEG Dataset
Description: A specialized dataset maintained by the University of Bonn, Germany, focusing on epileptic seizures.
Focus:
Primarily includes EEG recordings associated with various types of seizures.
Applications: Used extensively in research to develop seizure detection and prediction algorithms.
Key Features:
Emphasis on seizure-related EEG data.
Rich dataset suitable for studying seizure patterns and developing accurate classification models.

## Significance in the Project
The CHB-MIT EEG Database provides a balanced view of seizure and non-seizure EEG recordings, essential for training models to distinguish between normal and abnormal brain activities.
The Bonn EEG Dataset enriches the training process with a focused collection of seizure-specific EEG data, improving the model's ability to classify and detect seizure events.
These datasets are critical for building robust and accurate models for seizure detection and offer valuable insights for clinical applications in neurology.
